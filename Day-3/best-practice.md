## Node Affinity and Taints and Tolerations

We already know about Taints and Tolerations and Node Affinity. Let's see how we can use them together.

### Node Affinity and Taints and Tolerations

- Node affinity and taints and tolerations can be used together to ensure that a pod is scheduled on a node with a specific taint.
- This is useful when you want to ensure that a pod is scheduled on a specific node with a specific taint.
- For example, you have a node with a specific hardware configuration and you want to ensure that a pod is scheduled on that node.

#### How it works Actually?

- If we apply a taint to a node, then the node will repel the pods. But also we can't sure some specific pods should be scheduled on that node. there may be a chnace that specific pods should be scheduled on that other nodes.
- if we apply node affinity to a pod, then the pod will be scheduled on a node with a specific label. But also we can't block the other pods to be scheduled on that node.
- So, we can use taints and tolerations to repel the pods from the node and node affinity to ensure that the specific pods are scheduled on that node.
